                One day we went for his friend's party and when one of his friends talked to me all of 10 mins,
                he went into a jealous rage, poured the drink on the guy's head and stormed off, i apologised,
                chased after him and i jumped into the car, he sped off, going over speed bumps, screaming and
                shouting, abusing me, punching his windscreen, banging on the steering. All the red flags went
                up and i was very very angry and i was crying. i dont know where i got the strength from but
                i calmly told him to stop the car or i would.
